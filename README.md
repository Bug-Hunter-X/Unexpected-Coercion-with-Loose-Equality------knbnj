This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving loose equality (==) and null/undefined values.  The `bug.js` file contains code that incorrectly handles nulls and undefined using loose equality. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version. Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, causing errors that are difficult to track down.  Always use strict equality (===) for reliable comparisons, especially when dealing with null or undefined.
